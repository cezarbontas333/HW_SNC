General data characteristics:
-----------------------------
This is a time domain data set with 1 input(s) and 1 output(s), 1022 samples 
and 1 experiment(s).

All inputs in the data have been denoted as 'zero order hold' ('zoh'), i.e. 
they are assumed to be piecewise constant over the sample time.
If the input is a sampled continuous signal and you plan to build or convert to 
continuous-time models, it is recommended to mark the InterSample property as 
'First order hold': Data.InterSample = 'foh' or Data.InterSample = 
{'foh','foh', ...} for multi-input signals.

Some inputs and/or outputs have non-zero means. It is generally recommended to 
remove the means by DAT = DETREND(DAT), except in the following cases:
1. The signals are measured relative to a level that corresponds to a physical 
equilibrium. This could e.g. be the case if step responses are recorded from an 
equilibrium point. In this case, it is advisable to remove the equilibrium 
values rather than data means. You may do so using a TrendInfo object with 
DETREND command, or during estimation using the "InputOffset" and 
"OutputOffset" estimation options.
2. There is an integrator in the system, and the input and output levels are 
essential to describe the effect of the integration.
3. You are going to use the data to estimate nonlinear ARX models.

Excitation level in data:
-------------------------
The input is persistently exciting of order 50. This means that you will 
encounter problems if estimating models of order higher than 50.

Possibility of feedback in data:
--------------------------------
There is no significant indication of feedback in the data.
Use the "checkFeedback" command for assessment of feedback with more options.

Possibility of nonlinearity:
----------------------------
The input is binary.
Building nonlinear models with this data may be difficult. In particular, 
Hammerstein models (IDNLHW with only input nonlinearity) cannot be supported.

There is no clear indication of nonlinearities in this data set. Use the 
"isnlarx" command to perform the assessment of nonlinearity with more options.
